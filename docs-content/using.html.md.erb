This topic describes how to use the VMware Harbor Registry integration with Pivotal Container Service (PKS).

## <a id='prereqs'></a> Prerequisites

- Harbor is [installed and configured](./installing.html).
- Harbor is integrated with [PKS](./integrating-pks.html) or [PAS](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-12/opsguide/docker-registry.html#ops-man).

## <a id='starting'></a> Starting Harbor

To log in to VMware Harbor Registry, do the following:

1. In a web browser, navigate to `https://harbor_host_address:443`.

1. Enter the username `admin`.

1. Enter the password that you set when you configured Harbor for PKS. 

    <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> If the Harbor UI is not accessible, make sure you have completed the integration steps, including updating DNS for Harbor, trusting the certificate, and creating a NAT rule for the Harbor UI. For more information, see <a href="./integrating-pks.html">Integrating Harbor with PKS</a>.</p>
