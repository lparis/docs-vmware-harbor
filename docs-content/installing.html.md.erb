owner: Partners
---

This topic describes how to install and configure VMware Harbor Registry using Pivotal Ops Manager for use with Pivotal Container Service (PKS) and Pivotal Application Service (PAS). After you install and configure Harbor, you must provide the Harbor CA certificate to Ops Manager.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This documentation supports the Harbor v1.6 release.</p>

## <a id='install'></a> Import Harbor Tile to Ops Manager

1. Download the Harbor tile from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/).
1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product** to upload the product file. 
1. Below the **Import a Product** button, click the **+** button next to the VMware Harbor Registry version number to add the tile to your staging area.
1. Click the **Harbor** tile to begin the configuration process.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> When configuring Harbor in Ops Manager, be sure to click <strong>Save</strong> to preserve your changes.</p>

## <a id='configure_az_networks'></a> Assign AZs and Networks

1. In the Harbor tile, select the **Assign AZs and Networks** panel. 
1. Select the availability zone (AZ) to **place singleton jobs in**. VMware Harbor is a singleton job and is placed on this network.
1. Select the AZ where to **balance other jobs in**. For PKS, this is the same AZ as the singleton.
1. For **Network**, select the network on which to deploy Harbor. For PKS, this is the management network where you deploy the Ops Manager, BOSH Director, and PKS VMs.

## <a id='configure_general'></a> Configure General Settings

1. In the Harbor tile, select the **General** panel.
1. Enter a **Hostname** (FDQN, not IP) to access the Harbor administration UI and registry service. For example: `harbor.mycompany.com`. The hostname must include a domain and must be able to resolve to the IP of the Harbor instance VM by an external DNS server.
<br><br>
  Kubernetes worker nodes are able to resolve the Harbor FQDN via the local BOSH DNS server. So that Docker clients external to Kubernetes worker nodes can resolve the Harbor FQDN, you must provide a Harbor FQDN that is resolvable by an external DNS server. When Harbor is successfully deployed, you will need to update the Harbor external DNS record with IP address of the Harbor VM.
1. To use the default container network settings, choose the option **Keep the default container network settings**.
<img src="images/config-general-settings-default.png" alt="Configure General Settings for Harbor: Default" width="725">
1. To customize the container network settings, choose the option **Specify customized container network settings**.
  <br><br> 
  If you select the customize option, you must specify at least one address pool base and size. The address pool is used when a Docker container starts. The Docker daemon (dockerd) will allocate an IP address to this container; the IP address that is assigned is selected from the address pool.
  <br><br>
  For example, if you select this option, for the **Address pool1 base** you might enter `172.80.0.0/16`, and for the **Address pool1 size** you might enter `24`. Additional entry pairs are optional.

## <a id='configure_certificate'></a> Configure SSL Certificate and Key

At the **Certificate** page, you configure the SSL certificate and private key for Harbor. You can generate the certificate and private key or provide a custom signed certificate and private key. You also need to provide the CA cert, which is used to sign the Harbor certificate. The domain name used to generate RSA certificate in the Harbor Tile can be different than the domain name used to generate the RSA certificate in the PKS or PAS tile.

To use a certificate that Ops Manager generates automatically:

1. Click **Certificate**. 
1. Click **Generate RSA Certificate**.
1. Enter a domain name wildcard in the **Generate RSA Certificate** field. The domain name wildcard must match the DNS resolvable domain name that you used when you specified the hostname for Harbor. For example, if you set the Harbor hostname to `harbor.mycompany.com` enter `*.mycompany.com` in the **Generate RSA Certificate** field. 
1. Click **Generate**.

<img src="images/generate-rsa-cert.png" alt="Generate RSA Certificate for Harbor" width="425">

To use a custom signed certificate from a third-party Certificate Authority (CA):

1. Click **Certificate**. 
1. Paste the contents of the certificate file into the **Certificate Authority (CA)** field. Certificates must be in PEM-encoded format. The certificate CN or SAN must match the DNS-resolvable domain name that you used for the hostname for Harbor.
1. Paste the contents of the corresponding key (PEM) into the **Private Key PEM** field.         
1. Enter the **Certificate Authority (CA)** for the server certificate, which is used to sign the Harbor certificate. If you are using self-signed certificate, paste the corresponding CA here. Leave this field empty if you are using the root CA of Ops Manager.

<img src="images/cert-config.png" alt="Configure SSL certificate and private key for Harbor" width="725">

## <a id='images/configure_credentials'></a> Configure Harbor Credentials

1. Click **Credentials**. 
1. Set a password for the Harbor system administrator account. You cannot change the Harbor administrator password in Ops Manager after you set it during installation. You use the Harbor interface to make subsequent changes to the password after deployment.
1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='configure_authentication'></a> Configure Harbor Authentication Mode

At the **Authentication** page in Ops Manager you choose the authentication mode. You use the Harbor web console to configure detailed settings for the chosen authentication mode. For more information, see <a href="https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/blob/master/docs/user_guide.md#managing-authentication">Managing Authentication</a> in the Harbor User Guide documentation. 

1. Click **Authentication**. 
1. Choose the Authentication Mode.
   - **Internal** (default) - Harbor user credentials are stored in a local database
   - **LDAP** - LDAP authentication
   - **UAA in PKS** - User Account and Authentication with PKS
   - **UAA in Pivotal Application Service** - User Account and Authentication with PAS
1. Click **Save** if you made changes.

## <a id='configure_storage'></a> Configure Container Registry Storage

At the **Container Registry Storage** page you specify the type of file storage to use for storing container images.

1. Click **Container Registry Storage**. 
1. Choose the desired storage for container images:
  - **Local File System** (default)
  - **Remote NFS Server** (see below for configuration)
  - **AWS S3** (see below)
  - **Google Cloud Storage** (see below)
1. Click **Save**.

### Remote NFS Server Configuration

Provide the **NFS Server Address** in the form `nfs_server_ip:/path/to/export_directory`. 
For example: `192.0.2.0:/harbor/registry/export`. The user/group ID (UID) for the owner of the export directory on the NFS Server must be 10000:10000, where 10000 is the UID used by the Harbor Registry container.

## <a id='configure_clair'></a> Configure Container Vulnerability Scanning Using Clair

[Clair](https://github.com/coreos/clair) is an open-source project for the static analysis of vulnerabilities in Docker and appc containers. Harbor provides the ability to install and use Clair for vulnerability scanning of container images. Clair can be configured to update its Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database from the Internet by setting the **Updater Interval**. In an intranet network environment, configure a proxy to access the Internet.

1. Click **Clair Settings**. 
1. To enable container image vulnerability scanning, ensure **Install Clair** is selected.
If you deselect this checkbox, Clair is not installed.
1. (Optional) In the **HTTP Proxy** field, enter the URL to proxy HTTP traffic to the Clair service. For example: `http://my.proxy.com:3128`.

1. (Optional) In the **HTTPS Proxy** field, enter the URL to proxy HTTPS traffic to the Clair service.
   For example: `http://my.proxy.com:3128`.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> To use basic authentication with the HTTP/S proxy for Clair,
       include the user name and password in the proxy host URL, for example: <code>http://user:password@myproxy.internal.domain:8080</code>.</p>

1. In the **No Proxy** field, specify the endpoints that will bypass the proxy host. This field is required if Clair is installed. The default values, `127.0.0.1,localhost,ui`, are populated for you.

1. Append `registry` to the **No Proxy** field. For example, `127.0.0.1,localhost,ui,registry`. 

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The <code>registry</code> entry is required to avoid or work around a known issue with VMware Harbor Registry v1.6.0. Without the <code>registry</code> entry in the <strong>No Proxy</strong> field, you may receive an HTTP 400 Bad Request error with the message "could not find layer" when Clair attempts to pull images from the Harbor registry.</p>

1. In the **Updater interval (Hours)** field, specify when Clair will update its CVE database for the registered sources. When the updater interval expires, Clair will update its CVE database. If the updater interval is set to `0` (default), Clair will not update its CVE database. For example, if you set the interval to `24`, Clair will update its CVE database daily.

## <a id='configure_notary'></a> Configure Container Signing Using Docker Notary

Harbor provides [Docker Notary](https://docs.docker.com/notary/getting_started/#what-is-notary) for container signing and trust. Notary is installed by default.  

1. Click **Notary Settings**.
1. By default **Install Notary** is selected. Deselect to not install Notary.
1. Click **Save** if you made changes.

## <a id='configure_errands'></a> Configure BOSH Deployment Errands

Deployment errands are BOSH scripts that run at designated points during an installation using Ops Manager. 

1. Click **Errands**. 
1. For **Post-deploy Errands**, select the **smoke-testing** errand:
   - **On** (default)
   - **Off**
1. For **Pre-delete Errands**, select the **deregister Harbor UAA client** errand:
   - **On**
   - **Off** (default)
1. Click **Save** if you made changes.

## <a id='configure_resource_config'></a> Configure Harbor VM Resources

The Harbor VM runs as a single instance. At the **Resource Config** page you configure the resource settings for the Harbor VM, including disk size and type. If you are deploying Harbor on AWS or GCP, you can specify a load balancer that allows external access to the Harbor VM. 

For standard Harbor Registry deployments, the default size and type for the Harbor VM are sufficient. The compute and storage capacity of the Harbor VM depends on the size of the images you are deploying to the Harbor registry. Some images are 30MB, some are 2GB. In addition, storage requirements depend on how images are built and what base images are leveraged. In general, if your Harbor instance manages a large number of images, increase the storage size and select a VM type that has greater CPU capacity and more RAM. Using a smaller size VM than the default is not common.

If you are deploying Harbor using BOSH Director for AWS or GCP, and you are fronting the Harbor VM with a load balancer, provide its IP address in the resource settings. AWS or GCP load balancers can be internal or external. The load balancer type dictates whether you need to check or leave unchecked the **Internet Connected** option. The image below shows the load balancer "scheme" options for the AWS classic load balancer. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/elb-internal-load-balancers.html?icmpid=docs_elb_console">AWS internal load balancers</a>, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/elb-internet-facing-load-balancers.html">AWS Internet-facing load balancers</a>, and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/load-balancing-overview#external_versus_internal_load_balancing">GCP internal and external load balancers</a>.

<img src="images/aws-elb.png" alt="AWS ELB Type" width="725">

To configure the Harbor VM resources:

1. Click **Resource Config**.
1. To change the configuration of the `harbor-app` VM, edit the following properties:
  - **Instances**: This value cannot be changed. PCF supports one Harbor instance only.
  - **Persistent Disk Type**: Increase or decrease the storage capacity of the Harbor disk. 
  - **VM Type**: Select a VM type with more CPU capacity and RAM depending on your storage requirements.    
1. To change the configuration of the `smoke-testing` VM, specify the desired **VM Type**. This is an ephemeral VM deployed and used by BOSH to test the deployment of the Harbor VM. Typically the default size is sufficient. However, if you change the size of the `harbor-app` VM from the default, you may need to adjust the size of the `smoke-testing` VM accordingly.
1. For AWS and GCP environments, specify the name of the load balancer that allows external access to the Harbor VM. If you are using an Internet-facing load balancer, select the **Internet Connected** option. If the load balancer is internal, leave the setting unchecked.

## <a id='configure_stemcell'></a> Update the Stemcell

If the version of the Harbor tile that you are installing requires a more recent stemcell version than is currently deployed in Ops Manager, the Harbor tile displays the message "Missing stemcell.""

<img src="images/missing-stemcell.png" alt="Missing stemcell for Harbor" width="225">

To update the stemcell:

1. Return to the **Installation Dashboard** page in Ops Manager.
1. In the Harbor tile, click the **Missing stemcell** link. 
1. At the **Stemcell Library** page, copy the name and version of the required stemcell for Harbor.
<img src="images/required-stemcell.png" alt="Required stemcell for Harbor" width="625">
1. Log in to the [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/).
1. Search for **Stemcells for PCF (Ubuntu Xenial)**.
1. Download the required Harbor stemcell for your platform to the Ops Manager host. For example, if you are using vSphere, download the BOSH stemcell for vSphere that matches the required version. 
1. At the **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager, click the **Missing stemcell** link in the Harbor tile.
1. Click **Import Stemcell**, navigate to the stemcell you downloaded, and click **Open** to import the stemcell.
